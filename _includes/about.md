Hi! My name is Rostyslav and I am software developer from Kyiv, Ukraine.
I am mostly busy with C/C++ application development for Linux, doing embedded development time at a time.
Furthermore, I try to follow modern trends by learning the Rust programming language.
I use [NixOS](https://nixos.org) Linux distribution as my primary devbox and write code in Emacs.

I rarely post longreads, but I ocassionally write small notes in my [diary](diary.html). Check it out!
