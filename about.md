I am hobbyist programmer from Kyiv, Ukraine, who is interested mainly in `C/C++` programming, `OpenGL`and `Linux`.
I have been using `Linux`, `Debian` particularly, for almost two years, and became a `vim` user about four months ago.
On weekend evenings I stream my development process at [livecoding.tv](https://livecoding.tv/rostakagmfun).
Your feedback, guys, is really apreciated in any from, so don't be lazy: comment articles, share links, follow me on `twitter` and watch my `livecoding.tv` channel;
ask, love, hate, criticise and do whatever you want:)
