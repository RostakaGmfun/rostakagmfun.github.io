I am hobbyist programmer from Kyiv, Ukraine, who is interested mainly in C, C++, Python and Java programming, OpenGL, Linux, low-level Assembly and C for x86 and ARM platforms.
I use Linux, Debian distribution particularly, since 2013 and vim as my primary editor since 2015.
I am student at KPI University in Kyiv and part-time employed as a Junior C/C++ developer at CyberVision, Inc.
