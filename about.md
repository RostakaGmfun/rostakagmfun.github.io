![Avatar](/public/pixelavatar.png)
I am hobbyist programmer from Kyiv, Ukraine, who is interested mainly in `C/C++` programming, `OpenGL`, `Linux`, low-level `Assembly` and `C` for `x86` and `ARM`.
I have been using `Linux`, `Debian` particularly, since 2013, and became a `vim` user in January, 2015.

##Professional experience
On summer 2015 I'have worked as an Embedded C Junior Dev at Kaa Project. It is an innovative IoT platform for managing and connecting things.
Specifically, I've [ported](http://www.kaaproject.org/kaa-c-sdk-ported-to-esp8266/) Kaa Endpoint C SDK to new chip ESP8266 with WiFi onboard.
