# About

Hi!

My name is Rostyslav Kurylo and I am passionate about software, and technology behind it.
During my work days I am mostly busy with system programming for Linux and embedded platforms,
and that is also what I like to do in my spare time, though with more experiment and joy :)

I do not pretend to be a generalist, but I like to consider the whole hardware and software stack
when working on a project and make interesting obsevations about it.

This blog is meant to be a summary of what I've learned so far in the world of software engineering.
I am always open to discussion and will be glad to know your opinions about my writing.

This blog uses slightly modified [jekyll-minimal-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme).
