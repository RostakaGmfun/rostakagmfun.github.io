The end of the year draws a perfect opportunity to look back and reflect a bit. We think of how we changed during the year and what impacted us the most.
This post is basically a list of resources which I consider significant to me as a software engineer.
The list includes books, articles and videos which I have discovered during the 2016 and either did an "A-Z reading" or used as a reference.
