# Introduction
While writing my OpenGL/SDL2 game [engine](https://github.com/rostakagmfun/PixelGearEngine), I made a long way of learning OpenGL. In this short post I will list the best of OpenGL learning resources I've encountered so far.

## [Open.GL](https://open.gl/)
This great tutorial series is highly recommended for OpenGL 3.0 newbies.

## [OpenGL SuperBible](http://www.openglsuperbible.com/) ( both 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> editions)

This book has really good examples of different rendering techniques implemented with OpneGL 3.3 and OpenGL 4.3 graphics APIs.

## [OpenGL 4.0 Shading Language Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-4-0-Shading-Language-Cookbook/dp/1849514763)
![OpenGL 4.0 Shading Language Cookbook](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51HdayMiz7L.jpg)

Among numerous recipes, this book provides brilliant examples of lighting shaders and gives basic idea of shadows and particle systems.

## [OGLDev](http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/)

This collection of tutorials takes you step by step from creating a window and rendering a triangle to advanced rendering techniques.
