#Introduction
Whether you are saving your girlfriend kidnapped by aliens or travelling into the future and the past 
or just writing code, `git` has always been your friend. In this short atricle I will highlight 3 things I learned recently about git and find really useful.

#1. Colorizing git output
This feature is not enabled by default, but may come in handy while analyzing output of `git diff` or `git status` or whatever else.
Just typing this command makes you a git-rainbow-king:

    $ git config --global --add color.ui true

#2. Numeric output in `git diff`
Sometimes you want to see how many additions/deletions you've made since last commit. 
This command does the work and proves that you're just lazy coder who eats cookies and drinks coffee:

    $ git diff --numstat

#3. Counting lines in your repository
If you're not well-satisfied with previous tip, you can count lines in your repository proving once more that you haven't
done much progress since last time you've slept:

    $ git ls-files | xargs wc -l

However, you should remember, my young padawan, that "measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight." (Bill Gates), so don't concentrate a lot on 
how much code have you written, but pay attention to stability and quality of your software.

That's all for now, folks. Stay tuned for blog updates and don't forget to spread a word about this article if you like it.
