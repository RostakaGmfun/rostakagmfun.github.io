Here is a list of my projects, which you can find on my [GitHub page](https:/github.com/RostakaGmfun).

##bfuck
`bfuck` is a Brainfuck language interpreter which I write just for learning purposes 
(actually, I write everything just for having fun and learning :D)

##PixelGear Engine
![pxg-logo](/public/pxg-logo.png)
I have been writing this game engine for a few months and then
just gave up because the source code was cluttered a lot.
It uses SDL2 for window management, OpenGL 3 for graphics drawing 
and [Bullet Physics Library](http://bulletphysics.org/) for rigid body dynamics

* [Article about my engine](http://rostakagmfun.github.io/pxg-engine-design.html)

##modwm
`modwm` is a X11 window manager. This a project I am currently working on despite the lack of time.
