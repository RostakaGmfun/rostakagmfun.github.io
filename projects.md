## Kaa
On summer 2015 I've made a lot of contributions to open-source IoT platoform `Kaa`.
Particularly, I've ported C Endpoint SDK to `ESP8266` chip (with WiFi onboard).

## PixelGear Engine
![pxg-logo](/public/pxg-logo.png)
I have been writing this game engine for a few months and then
just gave up because the source code was cluttered a lot.
It uses SDL2 for window management, OpenGL 3 for graphics drawing 
and [Bullet Physics Library](http://bulletphysics.org/) for rigid body dynamics

* Language: C++
* [Source code](https://github.com/RostakaGmfun/PixelGearEngine)
* [Article about my engine](http://rostakagmfun.github.io/pxg-engine-design.html)
