##bfuck
`bfuck` is a Brainfuck language interpreter which I wrote just for learning purposes 
(actually, I write everything just for having fun and learning :D)
* Language: C

##PixelGear Engine
![pxg-logo](/public/pxg-logo.png)
I have been writing this game engine for a few months and then
just gave up because the source code was cluttered a lot.
It uses SDL2 for window management, OpenGL 3 for graphics drawing 
and [Bullet Physics Library](http://bulletphysics.org/) for rigid body dynamics
* Language: C++
* [Source code](https://github.com/RostakaGmfun/PixelGearEngine)
* [Article about my engine](http://rostakagmfun.github.io/pxg-engine-design.html)
